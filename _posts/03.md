## 1. Free of social media!

Unshackled! It's mad how great I've felt this month, and I really think it's because I've cut out social media. There's no more ‚Äúcheck me, check me‚Äù pulling at my attention. It's like a fog I didn't know was there has lifted. Coding feels fun again. I've got focus, I've got my attention back. This week, I've found myself getting lost in coding‚Äîsomething I haven't felt in ages. I've been super productive. I've knocked out everything I wanted to: the portfolio, my case studies, the Minesweeper clone (rewrote it in TypeScript). It's all been fun, like work used to be. I'm not grinding through it or forcing myself to focus anymore. I'm just enjoying coding again. I'll never go back to social media.

## 2. Fucking images! Optimising images for the web. BLAH! ü§Æ

This has had my life this week! After 10 years of coding, I‚Äôve never really had to deal with optimizing images before. That‚Äôs what happens when you work on enterprise apps for your whole career. I‚Äôve painfully discovered there‚Äôs a whole art to optimizing images for the web. It‚Äôs not just a matter of exporting an image and slapping it on a website! It‚Äôs been a bit of a grind, but I‚Äôve learned a few things:

- Use SVGs for logos. They scale and look great at any size.
- Use PNGs only when you need transparency in the image. Use JPGs for everything else.
- Use `<img />` tags over a `<div />` with a background image. It‚Äôs much better for accessibility and SEO.
- Use plain JPGs and add effects like drop shadows and borders in code. It keeps the file size low.

## 3. Everything doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect

My "good enough" is pretty good! I need to learn to trust that. I get hung up trying to make everything perfect, and in the process, I lose time. I need to work on this and trust myself more‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need to dig into every little detail to make it perfect. All these details no one would notice, but I know they‚Äôre there. When it comes to the designs for my portfolio, I get stuck trying to make them perfect when I really just need to get them out and apply what I‚Äôve learned to my next projects. Your second, third, and fourth designs are going to be way better than your first because you‚Äôve learned. It would be crazy to think that your very first design would be the best website anyone has ever seen. It‚Äôs not going to happen. Accept that it will have flaws, and learn from them!

## Thoughts/musings/ideas/views

- Cold shower high ‚Äî get on the bandwagon.
- When hungover, have breakfast. It keeps you productive, but don‚Äôt go for a dirty McDonald's bacon sandwich. Full-fat Coke works, though.
- AI is a great editor. When writing, you need to keep your voice, but I need someone to edit my words. AI is perfect for this.
- Vercel makes deploying websites so easy.
- Want to learn more about Next.js.
- Post-completion blues ‚Äî finished my portfolio/work and didn‚Äôt know what to do next. Also, a great song title.
