## My Experience with Copilot: A Work in Progress

I’m pretty sure using Copilot has made me more productive, but it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. That’s to be expected though—learning anything new has its bumps, especially when it challenges coding habits that have been built over 15 years. For the smaller tasks, it’s been really useful:

- `/fix` for TypeScript errors
- Inline chat to generate realistic mock data quickly
- Helping with those little things I always forget, like date formats `DDD mm, yyyy`
- Generating boilerplate code for React components

But it’s not without its problems:

- It’s slower than I thought. Generating a simple mock data array for 50 users took longer than expected.
- Asking big questions like, “Generate code for a TanStack table” gave me code that looked right but was actually wrong.
- Sometimes, IntelliSense just gets in the way.

Despite the issues, I’m still pretty happy with it and plan to keep using it for the next few months. One key to getting the most out of it has been working with the `copilot-instructions.md` file to customize how it works. I saw the benefit of this when I updated it to fit my preferred React component boilerplate. Copilot hasn’t completely blown me away, but it has definitely made me more productive.

## Keep Pagination Simple

I’m not a fan of those fancy pagination controls with the "1 2 3 ... 10" style. For one, they’re a pain to code, and two, the moving ellipsis makes the buttons jump around. It’s just messy. Virtualized scrolling? Not a fan of that either. It’s not native to the web, it’s not accessible, and it feels like a workaround.

The best way to design a table is with simple pagination and solid filters. No one’s paging through 1000 pages. They’re going to filter. So, focus on good filters! Offer basic pagination controls: a previous/next button and a dropdown to jump to specific pages. From there, it’s all about making sure the filters work well, so users can find what they need easily.

## How to Make Tables Accessible

If you're building tables, pagination is key. Avoid using virtualized scrolling—it’s not really supported natively by browsers. And please, don’t make entire rows clickable. Instead, give individual rows actions that users can actually interact with. Remember, an entire row isn’t a button! Just keep things simple and user-friendly.
